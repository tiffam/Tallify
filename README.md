# Tallify
Tally your vouchers with Tallify - a web app that records your vouchers so that you can track them easily. 

New vouchers can be created on the fly, and you can update their status as 'used' when you redeem them at the shops. Vouchers can be categorised into 4 different types: vouchers, gift cards, electronic vouchers and electronic gift cards.

In the next phase of development, you can edit vouchers, create vouchers for an expanded group of companies, and include companies that are not in our database.
