# Tallify
Tally your vouchers with Tallify - a web app that records your vouchers so that you can track them easily. 

Tracking your vouchers is easy and intuitive on Tallify. You can create your vouchers in a few clicks. Vouchers can be categorised as vouchers, gift cards, electronic vouchers and electronic gift cards. Once redeemed at the stores, you can tally your vouchers by indicating that they have been redeemed on the app.

More functionalities will be introduced in Version 2.0. For instance, you will be able to edit vouchers' content, create vouchers for an expanded group of companies, including companies that are not in our database. Embedded shop listings will also be rolled out for users to easily make reference to the nearest store in their neighbourhood.
